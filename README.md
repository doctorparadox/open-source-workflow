# Open Source Workflow
This is an experiment in Learning Out Loud and sharing the productivity tips and setups that work for me.

The goal is to champion Knowledge Work while continuously improving my own ability to turn information into knowledge -- and to help others think about their own workflows in whatever small ways I can.

## Obsidian Templates
I've written about my obsession with the [Obsidian note-taking/second brain tool](https://doctorparadox.github.io/thoughts.html#obsidian) -- and will undoubtedly sing its praises continuously from here on out! One very powerful piece of functionality of Obsidian is the ability to create Templates of frequently used bits of text (or even dynamic outputs, via [the Templater plugin](https://github.com/stars/doctorparadox/lists/obsidian-plugins)). This jives with the "DRY" ([Don't Repeat Yourself](https://www.plutora.com/blog/understanding-the-dry-dont-repeat-yourself-principle)) philosophy of object-oriented programming, as well as providing a standard structure for specific types of notes and of course, simply saving you time.

Some of my most useful templates are for note-taking on the media I consume. It stores a record of what I'm reading or watching, as well as helps me stay in the practice of trying to always take the time to put what I've learned into my own words. In the past I had focused more on just getting to the next book, article, or video -- but after some time soaking in the [PKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) community I realized there are diminishing returns associated with simply moving forward without stopping to codify the learnings. This always seemed obvious in an academic context when I was in school, but got lost along the way in the scrum to stay competitive in a fast-moving career and the general cult of speed and hyper-efficiency of modern-day capitalism. It feels good to reclaim a habit of Review Process!

Feel free to use [my templates](https://github.com/doctorparadox/open-source-workflow/tree/main/obsidian/templates) or simply riff on them to get ideas for your own process.
